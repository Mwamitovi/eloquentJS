/**
 * RegExp Golf
 * 
 * "Code golf" is a term used for 
 * the game of trying to express a particular program in as few characters as possible. 
 * Similarly, "regexp golf" is the 
 * practice of writing as tiny a regular expression as possible to 
 * match a given pattern, and only that pattern.
 * 
 * For each of the following items, 
 * write a regular expression to test whether any of the given substrings occur in
 * a string. The regular expression should match only strings containing one of the
 * substrings described. Do not worry about word boundaries unless explicitly mentioned. 
 * When your expression works, see whether you can make it any smaller.
 * 
 * Test each solution with a few test strings.
