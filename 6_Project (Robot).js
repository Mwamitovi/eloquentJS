/**
 * Task: Understanding the state of our postabot
 * 
 * There is "mail" in various places, each addressed to some other place.
 * Our postabot picks "mail" when it comes to them (start), 
 * and delivers this "mail" when it reaches their destinations (end).
 * The postabot must decide, at each point, where to go next.
 * It has finished it's task when all parcels have been delivered.
 * 
 * We need to create a model (virtual world) to simulate this process.
 * This model tells us where postabot is, and where the "mail" is too.
 * When postabot has decided to move somewhere,
 * we need to update the model to reflect this new situation.
 * 
 * So let's reduce the village state down to some values that define it.
 * There's postabot's current location, and the collection of undelivered "mail",
 * each of these has a current location and a destination address.
 * Also we need a way to compute a new state for each situation after the move,
 * not when postabot is moving (in transition).
