  * Village: Rubaga-North area, Kampala

  * We shall test case our postabot with a sample area served by the Mengo Post Office.
  * Our test involves 11 places with 15 routes between them.
  * This network of routes forms a graph, which is a collection of points (places) with
  * lines between them (roads). This graph will be the world that our "postabot" moves through.
